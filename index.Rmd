### About the data

Reviewing the help file "?ToothGrowth", we can see the breakdown as follows:

- A Study on the effect of two delivery methods Orange Juice or plain old Vitamin C for tooth growth.
- Sample size of 60 guinea pigs.
- Each animal recieving one of each three doses which are equally divided among 60 guinea pigs.
    - 20 receiving .05 mg OJ/VC, 20 receiving 1 mg OJ/VC, and 20 receiving 2 mg OJ/VC
- The reference link is a paywall but provides us with;
    - a title name "The Growth of the Odontoblasts of the **Incisor** Tooth as a Criterion of the Vitamin C Intake of the Guinea Pig: Five Figures" 
    - Date Published: 01 May 1947.
    - First page of the article summarises "Canadian Government undertaking study to provide good source of vitamin c for soldiers during war time." 
  
str(ToothGrowth) provided the technical information of the dataframe.  

### Environment

![Github](./Octocat.png) [view mycode](https://github.com/ranalytica/ToothGrowth){target="_blank"}
```{r Envir, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(glue)
library(cowplot)
library(tinytex)
library(matrixStats)
downloadDate <- date()

glue("Simulation date is {downloadDate}")
sessionInfo()
```

### Data Loading

```{r load}
attach(ToothGrowth)
```

### Format 

ToothGrowth shows 60 observations on 3 variables

- len - tooth length 
- supp - Supplement type (VC or OJ)
- dose - in milligrams/day

Using view(toothGrowth) we can see the following:

- range 1:30 len have a supp valuing "VC"
- range 31:60 len have a supp valuing "OJ"


```{r structure}
str(ToothGrowth)
```


```{r look}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

### Exploring the data

```{r}
e<-ggpaired(ToothGrowth, x = "supp", y = "len",
         color = "supp", line.color = "red", line.size = 0.4,
         palette = "jco")


e1 <- ggpaired(ToothGrowth, x = "supp", y = "len",
          color = "supp", palette = "jco", 
          line.color = "red", line.size = 0.4,
          facet.by = "dose", short.panel.labs = FALSE)


plot_grid(e,e1)
```

The graph on the left tells us the following:

- The median is higher in OJ vs VC
- The range is more spread out in VC compared to OJ
- The OJ minimum point is higher than VC
- The VC max point is higher than OJ
- Look at the quantiles below to see the spread of data across the boxplot
- OJ quantiles between 50%-75% are in 22.70-25.725 vs. VC which are 16.5-23.1 the distance between them are also staggering 25.725-22.70 = 3.025 for OJ vs. 23.1-16.5 = 6.6.  Mother nature is very effective at delivering vitamin C through OJ.  

```{r VC quantile, echo=FALSE}
tapply(ToothGrowth$len, ToothGrowth$supp, summary)
```

The graph on the right tell us the following:

- The median increase as the dosage increase
- VC delivery method is not an effective way of sourcing vitamin c unless it reaches the dose 2 mg per day.
  - During wartime, carrying an orange juice vs. a tablet is probably a different story.  
- Orange juice is very effective delivery method for vitamin c.
- The OJ range of the box plot on 2 mg decreases - sign of diminishing returns?
- Their respective p-values
- Check-out the quantiles below

```{r dose quantile, echo=FALSE}
by(ToothGrowth$len, INDICES = list(ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$dose), summary)
```

### Hypothesis Testing

H0 = mean of both OJ and VC are equal
Ha != H0 There is a difference in mean for VC and OJ 


```{r T-test}
OJ <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ")
VC <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC")

t.test(OJ$len,VC$len, paired = TRUE)
```
```{r}
mu <- ToothGrowth %>% group_by(supp) %>% dplyr::summarise("means"=mean(len))

ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x=len, color = supp))+geom_density()+
  geom_vline(data=mu, aes(xintercept=means, color=supp),
             linetype="dashed")
```
```{r}
x <- OJ$len
y <- VC$len

OJVC <-data.frame(x,y)
combOJVC <- OJVC %>% mutate("meanss" =rowMeans(OJVC))
mu1<-mean(combOJVC$meanss)

ggplot()+geom_density(data = combOJVC, aes(x=meanss), color="blue")+geom_vline(xintercept = mu1, linetype="dashed", color="blue")+labs(title = "OJ/VC Averages")
```



```{r}
lmfit <- lm(ToothGrowth$len~ToothGrowth$supp+ToothGrowth$dose)
summary(lmfit)
```

There is a statistically significant difference in means.  

```{r}
plot(lmfit)
```

Reject the null hypothesis because there are differences between the mean of OJ and VC.  

```{r T-test dose .5}
OJdose_.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==0.5) %>%  filter(supp=="OJ")
VCdose_.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==0.5) %>%  filter(supp=="VC")

t.test(OJdose_.5$len, VCdose_.5$len, paired = F, var.equal = F)
```

```{r}
OJdose_1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==1.0) %>%  filter(supp=="OJ")
VCdose_1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==1.0) %>%  filter(supp=="VC")

t.test(OJdose_1$len- VCdose_1$len)
```


```{r}
OJdose_2 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==2.0) %>%  filter(supp=="OJ")
VCdose_2 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==2.0) %>%  filter(supp=="VC")

t.test(OJdose_2$len- VCdose_2$len)
```

P-value is .967 not enough to reject the null hypothesis. The difference between OJ mean and VC Mean is -.08 is very close to 0 but still not equal to zero.  

###  Conclusion

There is a significant difference  between tooth length and dose levels across different delivery methods.  A higher dosage led to longer teeth. Based on our evidence, the orange juice delivery method is more effective than the alternative method. At dosage 2 mg, the OJ still has a comparable impact vs. VC but the effectiveness is not the same as the lower dosage.
