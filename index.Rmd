### About the data

Reviewing the help file for "?ToothGrowth" we can see the breakdwon of information as follows:

1. A Study on the effect of two delivery methods Orange Juice or plain old Vitamin C for tooth growth.
2. Sample size is 60 guinea pigs.
3. Each animal recieving one of each three doses which are equally divided among 60 guinea pigs.  
  - 20 receiving .05mg, 20 receiving 1mg, 20 receiving 2mg
4. The reference link is a paywall but provides as with
  - a title name "The Growth of the Odontoblasts of the **Incisor** Tooth as a Criterion of the Vitamin C Intake of the Guinea Pig: Five Figures" 
  - Date Published: 01 May 1947...
  - First page of the article: which summarises "Canadian Government undertaking study to provide good source of vitamin c for soldiers during war time." 
  
str(ToothGrowth) provided the technical information of the dataframe.  

### Environment

![Github](./Octocat.png) [view mycode](https://github.com/ranalytica/ToothGrowth){target="_blank"}
```{r Envir, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(glue)
library(cowplot)
library(tinytex)
library(matrixStats)
downloadDate <- date()

glue("Simulation date is {downloadDate}")
sessionInfo()
```

### Data Loading

```{r load}
attach(ToothGrowth)


```

### Format 

ToothGrowth shows 60 observations on 3 variables

- len - tooth length 
- supp - Supplement type (VC or OJ)
- dose - in milligrams/day

using view(toothGrowth) we can see the following:

- range 1:30 len have a supp valuing "VC"
- range 31:60 len have a supp valuing "OJ"
- we already know that the guine pigs are also equally the same dossage

```{r structure}
str(ToothGrowth)
```


```{r look}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

### Exploratoring the data

```{r}
e<-ggpaired(ToothGrowth, x = "supp", y = "len",
         color = "supp", line.color = "gray", line.size = 0.4,
         palette = "jco")+
  stat_compare_means(paired = TRUE)

# Box plot facetted by "dose"
e1 <- ggpaired(ToothGrowth, x = "supp", y = "len",
          color = "supp", palette = "jco", 
          line.color = "gray", line.size = 0.4,
          facet.by = "dose", short.panel.labs = FALSE)
# Use only p.format as label. Remove method name.
e1<-e1 + stat_compare_means(label = "p.format", paired = TRUE)
plot_grid(e,e1)
```

The graph on the left tells us the following:

- the median is higher in OJ vs VC
- the range is more spread out in VC compared to OJ
- the quantiles
- The OJ teeth length is concentrated on the higher spectrum of the length


- The median increase as the dosage increase
- VC delivery method is not an effective way of sourcing vitamin c unless it reaches the dose 2 mg per day.
  - During wartime, carrying an orange juice vs. a tablet is probably a different story.  
- Orange juice is very effective delivery method for vitamin c.
- The range on 2mg for OJ decreases - sign of diminishing returns?

```{r prepare data}

quantile(dose_.5)

dose_.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose=="0.5")
dose_1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==1.0)
dose_2 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(dose==2.0)


summary(lm(len~supp, data=dose_.5))
```


```{r}
fit <- lm(len~factor(dose)+supp, data = ToothGrowth, model =TRUE)
summary(fit)
plot(fit)
```
